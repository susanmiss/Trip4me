# Trip4me

Trip4me is a project about my own trips. I wanted to create a website from scratch using MERN technology.
There is an admin area where is possible to create, delete, and update a post with images.

## Technologies

MERN technology: MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js

## Installation

There are 2 folders inside the trip4me repo: trip4mefront and trip4meback. Please run npm install and npm start for each folder.

```
npm install
npm start
```

## Contributing
Pull requests and suggestions are welcome.
